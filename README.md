## Description:
We have used two ardrino - uno's to do this project, in which one is the transmitter and another is the reciver.
Using the digitalWrite functions in ardrino, we are able to generate the input pulse train.
using the analogRead function we can read the voltags of the received signal.

First we have done the design in the online simulator - TinkerCad

After that we have implemented this circuit using a long wire in place of the resistor and have done the same experiment using two laptops and two Arduinos

The code used is uploaded in the main folder.

## Results:
The results and working of the setup is captured in videos.

2) Offline experiment - i) The output measure d using oscilloscope - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P39Q5svHfI8V_8jASjIa2PavtRZHwKgR/view?usp=drivesdk
ii) The output measured using the serial plotter in the receivers ardriuno (in this bits rate was very high in sampling so the graph is moving fast in serial plotter, thats why we used external oscilloscope to perceive the result) - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4Rr9Gu7hVj4sLEHClPsmVffY8UCHm4S/view?usp=drivesdk
