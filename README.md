## Description:
We have used two ardrino - uno's to do this project, in which one is the transmitter and another is the reciver.
Using the digitalWrite functions in ardrino, we are able to generate the input pulse train.
using the analogRead function we can read the voltags of the received signal.

First we have done the design in the online simulator - TinkerCad
